# ESP-Miner_Shares_Check
ESP-Miner Shares Check is small Python program that continuously checks the counts of accepted shares from the Bitaxe at specified time interval.

If the number of accepted shares are not increasing, it will restart the Bitaxe.

It works with the latest version of ESP-miner from skot (https://github.com/skot/ESP-Miner)
